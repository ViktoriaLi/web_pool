<- Vector ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Vector class represents a methods for operations with vectors.

For Vector instance creating you need dest Vector mandatory and optional orig Vector.

An instance can be contructed with 2 orig and dest vectors:
new Vector( array( 'orig' => $vtxO, 'dest' => $vtxX ) );

Vertex.class.php need be included.

The class provides the following methods :

float magnitude();
Returns the vector’s length (or "norm").

Vector normalize();
Returns a normalized version of the vector. If the vector is
already normalized, returns a fresh copy of the vector.

Vector add( Vector $rhs );
Returns the sum vector of both vectors.

Vector sub( Vector $rhs );
Returns the difference vector of both vectors.

Vector opposite();
Returns the opposite vector.

Vector scalarProduct( $k );
Returns the multiplication of the vector with a scalar.

float dotProduct( Vector $rhs );
Returns the scalar multiplication of both vec- tors.

float cos( Vector $rhs );
Returns the angle’sAppendix cosine between both vec- tors.

Vector crossProduct( Vector $rhs );
Returns the cross multiplication of both vectors (right-hand mark!)
